                        <p class="what">HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language is a programming language<br> that is often used to construct websites. This website was constructed<br> using HTML, as well as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, another<br> programming language used for websites. You will find out more <br>about CSS further down on the page.) Programming in HTML <br>requires the use of elements, which require tags, which are all <br>constructed of matching greater than and less than signs. You will <br> find out more about tags and elements later. 
</p>
                        <h3>What is CSS</h3>
                        <p class="what">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets is a programming language used to <br> style websites. While HTML controls the content on a website, CSS<br> is what makes it presentable to the user.

CSS can be used to change colors, add animations, adjust fonts, and <br>everything inbetween.

                        <h3>What are Tags and Elements</h3>
                        <p class="what">Elements are what HTML code consists of. Tags consist of angle brackets<br> with keywords in between them, and then content in between tags. Example <br>element syntax is <xmp><keyword>content</keyword></xmp> If you want to add a paragraph to the page, you need to create an element that <br> tells the computer to read it as a paragraph. The way you do this is using the <p> tag. The full syntax would be <xmp><p>(What you want to write)</p></xmp> At the bottom of the page is a table showing many example tags.
</p>
                        <h3>CSS Syntax and Attributes</h3>
                        <p class="what">In CSS, to control how the content from the HTML is presented,<br> you need to use the following Syntax.<br><br>
(Object you want to change){<br>
(How you want it to change)<br>
}<br><br>
For example, if you wanted to make all your paragraphs have blue<br> text and a green background, you would do<br><br>
p{<br>
color:blue; (Pay attention to semicolons and colons)<br>
background-color:green;<br>
}<br><br>
If you only want to change one paragraph, or a specific selection<br> of paragraphs, that’s where attributes come in. Attributes contain <br>IDs and Classes. ID’s specifically describe one element of HTML.<br> For example, you might assign your first paragraph an ID of <br>“intro”, to show that it is the introduction paragraph. Classes <br>describe many elements. For example, you might give all of your <br>paragraphs in a certain section of your website a class of “section1”.<br><br>

Now that you know what attributes are, it’s time to learn how to use them.<br> A paragraph with an ID of intro would be formatted like this: <xmp><p id=”intro”>content</p></xmp>,and a paragraph with a class of section1 would be formatted like this: <xmp><p class=”section1”>content</p></xmp>. Now you need to know how to use CSS to change the appearance of <br>elements with specific IDs and classes. The standard CSS syntax remains <br>mostly the same, but you lead the names of IDs with #s, and the names<br> of classes with a period. So the formatting looks like this:
<br>#ID{<br>
(Changes Made)<br>
}<br>
And:<br>
.class{<br>
(Changes Made)<br>
}<br>
