                      <p>15 years from that incredible event, it is now 2014 and I continue to live my <br> legendary life. Today, I am a high school student in 10th grade.</p>
                      <p>As mentioned, I am very interested in everything to do with computers and <br> video games. Some of my favorite games are: <ul>
                          <li><a href="tf2.com">Team Fortress 2</a></li>
                          <li><a href="reddit.com/r/smashbros">Super Smash Bros</a></li>
                          <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City">Batman: Arkham City</a></li>
                          <li><a href="thinkwithportals.com">Portal 2</a></li>
                          <p>Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game because of the variety of gameplay <br> offered. It has the perfect formula to make a game you can excel at, but still <br> feels new everytime and there is always something you can learn</p>
                      </ul></p>
                      <p>One of my other favorite things to do is watch and play hockey. When I first <br> started playing I decided to be a goalie, and have stuck with that decision <br> through my 9 year career. Throughout my playing time, I have taken home several awards. Some of the most important are:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>Gold Medal When Playing For Team California at Nationals</li>
                          <li>Taking MVP of Aforementioned Nationals With a 1-0 Shutout Win in the <br>Gold Medal Game</li>
                          <li>Winning West Coast Nationals With My Travel Team</li>
                      </ol>
