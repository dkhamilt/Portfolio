Input devices such as a keyboard can be used to give commands to the computer, and output devices such as monitors and speakers are used to display the results of these commands. As mentioned some peripherals include keyboards, which are basically large arrays of buttons (generally with letters on them) used to input data, mice, which are devices that allow you to navigate and select things freely on a two dimensional plane, and monitors, which are visual displays that can display things such as text and images.</p>
